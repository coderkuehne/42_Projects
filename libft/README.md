    <h1>Libft Documentation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Libft documentation! This is a fundamental project at 42 that I completed to build my own C library containing essential functions frequently used in C programming. This library serves as a solid foundation for many other projects, providing me with a set of utility functions that I can reuse throughout my journey at 42.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>As I worked on the Libft project, I aimed to achieve the following learning objectives:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Enhancing My C Programming Skills:</strong> Throughout this project, I challenged myself to implement crucial functions from scratch, deepening my understanding of C and improving my coding proficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Allocation and Management:</strong> I got hands-on experience with dynamic memory allocation and management in C, as some functions required efficient memory allocation.</li>
    <li><strong>Understanding Standard Library Functions:</strong> This project allowed me to peek behind the scenes of standard library functions and comprehend how they are implemented.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Libft project is organized into three main parts:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Libc Functions:</strong> This section involves re-implementing some standard library functions from <code>libc</code>, such as string manipulation, memory functions, and basic I/O functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Functions:</strong> Here, I implemented extra functions that are not part of the standard C library but can be incredibly useful in various projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus Part:</strong> The bonus section provided an opportunity to implement additional functions, which were evaluated only if the mandatory part was correct. These bonus functions could earn me extra points.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>To use the Libft library in my C projects, I can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I'll clone the Libft repository to my local machine using the <code>git clone</code> command.</li>
    <li>Navigating to the "libft" folder, I can compile the library by running the <code>make</code> command, which creates a <code>libft.a</code> archive file.</li>
    <li>In my other 42 projects, I'll include the header file <code>libft.h</code> and link the <code>libft.a</code> archive during compilation to utilize the library functions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions to the Libft project are welcome! If I come across any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, I can create an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the creators of 42 for designing the Libft project and providing me with the opportunity to enhance my C programming skills.</p>
