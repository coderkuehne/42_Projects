<h2>Introduction to 42 Wolfsburg</h2>
<p>42 Wolfsburg is part of the global network of 42 coding schools, which originated in France. The school aims to provide a free and intensive coding education without traditional teachers or formal lectures. At 42, students are encouraged to learn through hands-on projects, peer collaboration, and problem-solving.</p>

<h2>Learning Model at 42</h2>
<p>The learning model at 42 Wolfsburg is based on the principle of peer-to-peer learning and autonomy. Students have access to a wide range of coding challenges and projects, which they can complete at their own pace. There are no formal classes or instructors; instead, students learn by working on projects and helping each other in a collaborative environment.</p>
<p>The learning model emphasizes self-reliance, resilience, and adaptability â€“ essential skills for navigating the fast-paced world of technology. It encourages students to be proactive in their learning journey and take ownership of their education.</p>

<h2>Curriculum Structure and Projects</h2>
<p>The 42 Wolfsburg curriculum is structured around a series of projects, each designed to teach specific skills and concepts. Here are the projects included in this repository:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Libft - This project focuses on recreating a library of essential C functions, helping to solidify fundamental programming concepts and improve code reusability.</li>
    <li>ft_printf - The goal of this project is to implement a simplified version of the printf function, improving understanding of variadic functions and string parsing.</li>
    <li>get_next_line - This project involves writing a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, enhancing knowledge of file I/O and memory management.</li>
    <li>BornToBeRoot - BornToBeRoot is a system administration project that delves into the basics of managing user privileges and system security.</li>
    <li>piepex - This project explores the concepts of inter-process communication and helps students gain familiarity with pipes and fork.</li>
    <li>push_swap - The push_swap project involves creating an algorithm to sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of instructions, honing problem-solving and algorithmic skills.</li>
    <li>FdF - FdF is a graphical project that involves creating a simplified 3D wireframe representation of a terrain map, improving proficiency in graphic programming.</li>
    <li>Philosophers - In this project, students explore concurrent programming by simulating the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
<p>Each project in the 42 Wolfsburg curriculum is designed to teach essential programming skills, including problem-solving, memory management, algorithm design, and teamwork. Additionally, students learn the value of perseverance, adaptability, and collaboration â€“ traits that are crucial in the world of software development.</p>
<p>Through these projects, students not only acquire technical expertise but also develop a growth mindset and a passion for continuous learning, setting them on a path to becoming successful and innovative software engineers.</p>
